We're using a JSON file to organize the data of the club members. To add your own data, 
please begin by doing the following steps:

1. Locate the members.json file. It should be within the same directory as this file 
   (Assuming none of you guys moved this file).

2. Next to the CLOSING BRACKET of the BOTTOM-MOST entry, add a comma to separate your 
   entry. Examples can be seen above with others.

3. Add in your data. You may fill out this template below and paste it where your entry 
   will be.

{
    "name": "full name here",
    "role": "your role in the club here",
    "image": "link to an image for your profile picture here",
    "gradientStart": "hexcode here (You can find hex codes using 
    https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ and paste the HEX code in here)",
    "gradientEnd": "hexcode here",
    "link": "a direct link to your personal page (You can ignore this if you don't have your own page yet)"
}

As always, you may use the other examples present in there if you're unsure about something.

4. Correct any formatting or indentation faults that may be present. Please ensure the
   indentation and formatting fits amongst the other entries (I'll reject your PR otherwise).

5. Check the website(locally) to see if any changes are present. React uses a real-time compiler
   so your changes should be visible the moment you make them.
